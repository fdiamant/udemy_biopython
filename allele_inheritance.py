# Allele inheritance
#
# Write code that simulates the reproduction between two parents (AA, Aa, aa) 
# and show their offspring based on the probability of inheritance of each allele.
# The program must also show the percentage of each genotype in the offspring.
# 
# Example:
# Parent1: AA
# Parent2: Aa
# N. of offspring: 5
#
# AA  AA  AA  AA  AA
# Aa  Aa  Aa  Aa  Aa
# --  --  --  --  --
# AA  Aa  AA  Aa  AA
